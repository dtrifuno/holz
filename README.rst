TODO
=====================

These are the features I am currently working on.

* **Write a GUI.** Holz currently uses a CLI, which makes it 

* **Profile and optimize.**

* **Increase the number of supported players to 4.** Currently only supports two players.

* **Increase test coverage.**

* **Initial setting.** Currently you can only add cards one at a time, which means you cannot use Holz to set your starting five cards.
